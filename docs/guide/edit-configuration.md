# Editing Configuration

If you want to customize the configuration of the project, you can follow the long list of what can you customize below. All of these are located in the `config.mts` file.

## Customizing the Theme

To customize the theme, you can change the following variables inside the `themeConfig` object in the `config.mts` file:

### Navigation Island

You can change multiple things in the navigation island:

Customizing the navigation links in your Aplós template is a straightforward process, specifically in the `nav` section:

```ts
nav: {
    links: [
        { text: "Link 1", link: "/1" },
        { text: "Link 2", link: "/2" },
        { text: "Link 3", link: "/3" },
        // ...
      ],
      git: "https://gitsomething.example/GabsEdits/gabs.eu.org", // The Link to your Git repo
      rss: "/atom.xml", // The Link to your RSS feed
    },
```

### Footer {#footer-config}

Customizing the Footer in your Aplós template is a straightforward process, specifically in the `footer` section:

```ts
    footer: {
      copyright: true, // Show the copyright
      poweredBy: true, // Show the "Powered by Aplós & VitePress" text

      madeby: { // The "Made by" section, like " Made with ❤️ by Mr Example"
        show: false, // Show the "Made by" section
        name: "Mr Example", // Your name
        link: "https://gabs.eu.org", // Your website
      },

      copyleft: { // The "Copyleft" section
        show: true, // Show the "Copyleft" section
        license: "MIT License", // The license you are using
        info: "https://github.com/GabsEdits/gabs.eu.org/blob/main/LICENSE", // The link to the license
      },
    },
  },
```

### Blog

Customizing the Blog in your Aplós template is a straightforward process, specifically in the `blog` section:

```ts
    blog: {
      data: {
        repo: "Foo/Bar",
        repoid: "ExaMpLe",
        categoryid: "Exa_MPle",
      },
    },
```

> Make sure to replace the `repo`, `repoid`, and `categoryid` with your own values.

The `data` object contains the variables to make the [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) comments show, for more information check the [Giscus documentation](https://giscus.app/).

>[!WARNING] Warning
> The variables above are only needed if you use Giscus as the comment provider in your blog post. If you use ActivityPub, you can ignore these variables.

## Customizing Colors

To customize the accent color, you can change the following variables inside the `vite` -> `css` -> `preprocessorOptions` -> `scss` -> `additionalData`:

```ts{6}
  vite: {
    css: {
      preprocessorOptions: {
        scss: {
          additionalData: `
          $color-accent: !!YOUR_COLOR_HEX!!;
          `,
        },
      },
    },
  },
```

Replace `!!YOUR_COLOR_HEX!!` with your desired color hex code.

## Markdown Configuration

To customize the markdown configuration, you can change the following variables inside the `markdown` object in the `config.mts` file:

```ts
  markdown: {
    container: {
      warningLabel: "⚠ Warning",
      tipLabel: "Tip",
      dangerLabel: "⚠ Danger",
      infoLabel: "Info",
    },
  },
```

VitePress uses [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) to highlight language syntax in Markdown code blocks. Shiki provides [a long list of themes](https://shiki.style/themes) from which you can choose the one that fits the best your project. To change the theme, add the following variables (also inside the `markdown` object):

```ts
    theme: {
      light: "light-plus",
      dark: "dark-plus",
    },
```

For more information on how to customize the markdown configuration, you can check the [VitePress documentation](https://vitepress.dev/reference/site-config#markdown).

## General Website Configuration

To customize the general website configuration, you can change the following variables inside the `head` object like on an normal HTML Webpage, here is an example:

```ts
  head: [
    ["meta", { name: "author", content: "Mr. Example" }],
    ["link", { rel: "icon", href: "/favicon.ico" }],
    ["meta", { name: "theme-color", content: "#1a2b3c" }],
    ["meta", { name: "og:type", content: "website" }],

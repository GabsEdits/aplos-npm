## Name

The name 'Aplós', pronounced as `/aplós/` is the Romanized representation of the Greek word 'Απλός,' which translates to 'Simple'. This naming choice showcases the essence of the project— it's dedication to providing users with a straightforward and modern web experience. Aplós is centered around the philosophy of simplicity, aiming to deliver an uncomplicated and contemporary solution for website creation.

## Try & Use

You can install the package with the following command:

```bash
npm i aplos
```

## Release Cycle

Now that Aplós is an NPM Package, a release cycle is required. There is a new version every Saturday at 16:00 GMT for regular small updates (if there are changes), and for more critical updates every time there is a need.

### Versioning

Aplós uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), so you can understand the changes by looking at the version number (using the `major.minor.patch` format).

It might be possible that the pre-release versions start as a patch version and end up becoming a minor version (e.g: `2.1.3-1` -> `2.2.0-2`).

### 'Next' Tag

The 'next' tag is an nightly version of Aplós, used to test the next version before it is released. Use the 'next' tag if you want to test the next version of Aplós.

You can install the 'next' tag with the following command:

```bash
npm i aplos@next
```
